## üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª‚Äç Run / Compile it locally

Setup your React Native environment by following the [Getting started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) (React Native CLI Quickstart).

After cloning the project, initialize its node environment, compile the TypeScript and finally the native version:
```bash
$> yarn
$> tsc

# then for iOS
$> cd ios
$> pod install
$> cd ..
$> react-native run-ios

# or for Android - make sure to have your emulator running or phone connected in developer mode
$> react-native run-android
```

To get an insight into the redux action flow, state and log, use [react-native-debugger
](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) and the ```Debug``` mode via React Native's shaking menu.

To let it use your local [docker development environment](https://devdocs.foodsharing.network/getting-the-code.html) instead of production endpoints, set ```PRODUCTION``` to ```false``` in the [configuration file](https://github.com/rastapasta/foodsharing/blob/master/src/common/config.tsx#L1).

## üë®‚Äçüíª‚Äçüë©‚Äçüíª Run the E2E tests

Setup your detox environment by following the [Step 1](https://github.com/wix/Detox/blob/master/docs/Introduction.GettingStarted.md#step-1-install-dependencies) of detox's documentation.

Afterwards, first compile the test version (only needed once per native breaking change) and start the tests afterwards:

```bash
$> detox build --configuration ios.sim.debug
$> detox test --configuration ios.sim.debug
```

## ü§î Personal ToDos

* Should have
  * Optimize and benchmark rendering
  * Android
    * Camera, when first blocking permissions, going to settings, granting them, return -> overlay stays visible
    * Map markers on location selector scene is lagging behind movement
  * Reflect REQUEST_ERROR errors in the seperate UIs instead of silently canceling the loading/sending
  * Pull conversation again when open and coming from background to make sure its marked as read
  * Notifications after background pull / detect new conversations - even pull pull conversations? Delta algo!
  * Handle WebSocket reconnect after long inactivity
  * Clean up old navigation state system - only needed to track if and which conversation a user is watching atm
  * If both mobile and landline numbers are defined for a basket to request, ask the user which to call

* Nice to have
  * Make sure there is no gap between old store and long-time-no-see message list request -> hotfix: logout-in
  * Settings screen to setup background pull / notifications?
  * Use ```CONVERSATIONS_SUCCESS``` to warm up conversation's message (at least one)
  * State for loading conversations overview for loading indicator

* Feature creep
  * Edit profile information / M√ºtze :)

## üò¢ Why some few German in between the UI? (example: foodsaver profile scene)

While the app and its screens are fully [i18n translated](https://github.com/rastapasta/foodsharing/blob/master/assets/translations/en.json), a few [foorsharing endpoints](https://gitlab.com/foodsharing-dev/foodsharing/tree/master/src/Controller) deserve some love by someone motivated. Information like the profile details are returned by the backend in German only - fix it, and i will adapt it!
